						<h3>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/andrea_fresa.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
						I was born in Mexico City and lived there until I was 13. When I was a kid, many years before we moved to the US,
						my dad started a cooperative, initially composed of a small network of organic farmers from rural 
						areas across the country. Frustrated by the fact that distributors, supermarket chains, and other middlemen took the majority 
						of the profits while farmers received just pennies on the dollar, his goal was to create a direct avenue for these farmers to 
						sell their produce and products to consumers in the city. With farmers at the heart of his operation, constant communication and 
						travel were necessary. Curious to see other parts of the country, I eagerly accompanied my dad whenever possible. He wanted to 
						expand my worldview and expose me to the realities faced by much of the population outside of Mexico City. Rural Mexico, rich with 
						local folklore and Indigenous culture, was a world far removed from my urban daily life.
						<br />
						<br />
						These formative childhood experiences, coupled with an obsession with NatGeo WIld documentaries, sparked my ecological curiosity. 
						While I cannot claim an unbroken commitment to socio-ecological studies from that early age, those experiences left a lasting 
						impression. Many of my colleagues in fisheries science have a deep connection to water, having grown up near coasts or large bodies 
						of water. While I don’t share that connection with marine environments, I feel a similar bond with degraded terrestrial ecosystems 
						(sad as that may sound), coming from a big city where that was the only kind of “nature” I was surrounded by on a day-to-day basis.
						<br />
						<br />
						I reconnected with this part of myself during college, particularly in an ecosystem ecology course that introduced me to the study 
						of soils and rhizosphere processes. I was compelled by a field that was so dynamic, scalable, and intersectional. When I heard the 
						professor teaching the class was setting up her Soil Microbiology and Arctic Forests lab, I reached out to inquire about research 
						assistant and thesis student positions.
						<br />
						<br />
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/and_roots.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
						During my undergraduate thesis, I became intrigued by how small-scale processes, such as microbial nutrient cycling, have 
						far-reaching implications for climate change. I began exploring how root traits and soil microbial communities influence ecosystem 
						responses to disturbance, how they adapt to varying water and nutrient availability, and, in turn, affect nutrient cycling. I also 
						developed a general interest in the relationship between plant functional traits and seedling recruitment. However, the observational 
						nature of my thesis, which focused on describing trends and lacked a field component, occasionally made me feel disconnected from my 
						work. There was no clear downstream objective to inform management or policy.
						<br />
						<br />
						My love for learning was reignited by my experience as Assistant Lead of a field crew conducting post-fire surveys in the Southern 
						Sierra Nevada. We collected a wide range of data related to the regeneration of Giant Sequoia and mixed conifer groves. After spending 
						years frustrated by academic abstraction, the immersive hands-on work helped me reconnect with a grounded curiosity. It also generated 
						a number of questions about overlooked ecological processes–namely, the absence of soil or root sampling in the protocol. Realizing 
						that my first instinct was to design a follow-up project was incredibly reaffirming.
						<br />
						<br />
						This blend of experiences led me to reflect deeply on ecosystem resilience and post-disturbance recovery. I developed a profound interest 
						in climate adaptation research, particularly because it centers environmental justice and encourages us to consider diverse forms of 
						socio-ecological knowledge. How can plant-soil research enhance our understanding of healthy ecosystems? How can I better understand 
						the meaning of responsible and equitable socio-ecological restoration? How can we design studies that isolate functional mechanisms 
						while maintaining a holistic ecological perspective? How do we translate small-scale findings to heterogeneous environments? Who benefits 
						from studying these dynamics? How can I find my niche in this space, and how can this research contribute to policy-level change?</p>

						<h3>PERSONAL INTERESTS</h3>
						<p>I am passionate about a wide range of hobbies, and with each move to a new place or new acquaintance, 
						I find new interests to love. 
						</br>
						At the core of who I am are painting, reading, running, and dancing.
						<br />
						I’ve been drawing, painting, and doodling since I was a toddler, encouraged by my artistic parents to 
						explore creative expression. Visual arts have helped me understand both the benefits and challenges of 
						perfectionism, while also fostering my attention to detail.
						<br />
						Dancing, on the other hand, allows me to let go of control and trust my instincts. It’s a form of expression 
						that reconnects me to myself and grounds me, while also offering a space for building community. The inclusive 
						and collaborative dance spaces I’ve been part of have influenced the energy I bring to other group settings.
						<br />
						Running provides a meditative escape, helping me relax and de-stress, while also allowing my driven side to 
						flourish. What started as a way to carve out time for myself has become a disciplined practice that helps me stick 
						to routines and long-term goals.
						<br />
						Reading has also become a regular part of my life again. I set aside time every weekend to read and annotate books, 
						and I listen to audiobooks while I run or work. One of my coworkers and I even started a sci-fi book club, which has 
						been a great way to exchange ideas and perspectives across generations, challenging me to think critically and stay 
						open-minded. Below are some of my favorite books, including a few that, while not light reads, have profoundly shaped 
						my thinking. Some were assigned in class, and although I only read certain sections, certain themes and concepts 
						importantly informed the perspectives I have today.</p>
